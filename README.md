Printed Circuit Board files for the MVCA's Arduino Datalogger
-------------------------------------------------------------
All the files for the MVCA datalogger shield compatible with the Arduino Mega 2560

**This project was created using EasyEDA, thus we recomend using EasyEDA**
	- EasyEDA is a free PCB designer that is conencted to JLCPCB (a pcb printing company) which allows to see if JLCPCB has the components being used in stock

Files contained:
	1) "Data Logger Shield V2.schdoc" -> used on Altium Designer
	2) "SCH_Data Logger Shield V2.json" -> used on EasyEDA
	3) "Schematic_Data Logger Shield V2" -> used to replicate the PCB in other desiging software 

"Ordering_PCB" Folder:
	- This can be used to directly order the PCB file on JLCPCB
	- Log into JLCPCB and follow the page to order the PCB
	- Make sure to get the PCB Assembled (where the BOM and CPL files are needed)
